# Projetos-Estrutura-de-Dados

# Data Structures Projects

This repository contains implementations and projects of various **data structures in C**, created for study and practice purposes.

## 📘 Overview

Each folder includes a project related to a specific data structure or algorithm, such as:

* **Red-Black Tree** – self-balancing binary search tree.
* **Huffman Coding** – compression algorithm using binary trees.
* **SAT Solver** – prototype of a Boolean satisfiability solver.
* **Counting and Plotting** – data processing and analysis project.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iancarlosct/Projetos-Estrutura-de-Dados.git
   ```
2. Enter a project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Projetos-Estrutura-de-Dados/(foldername)
   ```
3. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   gcc (mainfilename).c -o main
   ./main

   //for huffman we use makefile to run it:

   make
   ./build/main
   ```

## 🎯 Purpose

* Practice and learn about classical data structures.
* Explore efficient implementations in C.
* Serve as reference or teaching material for students.
